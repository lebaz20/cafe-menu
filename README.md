# cafe-menu
Basic cafe menu application built on [Hasura](docs/backend.md) (graphql) in back-end and [CRA](docs/frontend.md) (reactjs) in front-end.

- Run `./scripts/start.sh` to start the application.

- Run `./scripts/test.sh` to run feature tests.

Not that, We rely on having docker installed on the host machine. All parts of the application run through docker images to avoid relying much on the host machine itself.
